# Graylog Solution Engineer POC Docs

This is a repository of instructions related to installing, upgrading, and configuring graylog.

## FAQ

* Is this intentionally public?
    * YES. There isn't anything inherently proprietary and builds off of existing public facing and published information.
* Why does this exist?
    * Short answer is we (Solution Engineers) needed a quick and low effort way to publish very tight documentation (think copy/paste instructions with no variables or guesswork) to share with people who may wish to complete a Graylog Proof of Concept (/Proof of Value/Trial)
